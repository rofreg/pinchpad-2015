//
//		TrackedTouch class
//

//! @class TrackedTouch
//! @abstract The purpose of TrackedTouch is to be a central class for correlating UITouches and location
//! data. The problem is that sometimes you can have a touch that while in the same location has a
//! different pointer. There can also be the case where there is the same pointer and slightly different
//! x and y. This class attempts to contain that knowledge
@interface TrackedTouch : NSObject

//! @function isRejected
//! @returns returns whether or not this touch point has been rejection by the touch rejection
//! algorithms
-(BOOL)isRejected;



//! @property currentLocation
//! @abstract Provides the most current location of this touch point corresponding to the current touch
//! location of the contained UITouch. When this coordinate represents a stylus it has been modified to
//! improve stylus accuracy
@property (readonly) CGPoint currentLocation;



//! @property previousLocation
//! @abstract Provides the presious location of this touch point corresponding to the current touch
//! location of the contained UITouch. When this coordinate represents a stylus it has been modified to
//! improve stylus accuracy

@property (readonly) CGPoint previousLocation;



//! @property currentTouchLocation
//! @abstract Provides the most current location of this touch point. This point is the current touch
//! location contained in UITouch. This touch point does not have any stylus corrections applied.
@property (readonly) CGPoint currentTouchLocation;



//! @property previousTouchLocation
//! @abstract Provides the presious location of this touch point. This point is the previous touch
//! location contained in UITouch. This touch point does not have any stylus corrections applied.
@property (readonly) CGPoint previousTouchLocation;



//! @property associatedTouch
//! @abstract This property is used to provide easy access to the UITouch being tracked
@property (readonly) UITouch * associatedTouch;

//! @property isStylus
//! @abstract This property is used to provide easy access to the knowledge of whether or not this
//! Tracked Touch is the stylus.
@property (readonly) BOOL isStylus;

@end  // @interface TrackedTouch


//
//		TouchManager class
//

//! @class TouchManager
//! @abstract The purpose of TouchManager is to be the container for TrackedTouch'es such that you can
//! query it to see if a touch is in it adjust touches' locations. This is also the all important
//! keeper of the pen touch concept not to mention the touch rejection construct.
@interface TouchManager : NSObject

//! Returns the singleton TouchManager
+(TouchManager *)GetTouchManager;



//! @function count
//! @returns the number of TrackedTouches contained within the class.
-(NSUInteger)count;



//! @function addTouches
//! @returns nothing
//! @abstract takes the touches passes in to touchesBegan and adds them to an internal list for tracking
//! and use in touch rejection as well as stylus detection
-(void) addTouches:(NSSet *)touches_I knownTouches:(NSSet *)knownTouches_I view:(id)view_I;



//! @function moveTouches
//! @returns nothing
//! @abstract takes the touches passes in to touchesMoved and adds them if necessary to an internal list
//! for tracking, updates existing entries with the current and previous locations, and used in touch
//! rejection as well as stylus detection
-(void) moveTouches:(NSSet *)touches_I knownTouches:(NSSet *)knownTouches_I view:(id)view_I;



//! @function removeTouches
//! @returns nothing
//! @abstract takes the touches passes in to touchesEnded and removes them form the internal list of
//! TrackedTouches.
-(void) removeTouches:(NSSet *)touches_I knownTouches:(NSSet *)knownTouches_I view:(id)view_I;



//! @function getTouches
//! @returns returns the UITouch for the Stylus touchpoint if touch rejection is turned on. Otherwise,
//! it returns all of the UITouch points it knows about which will include the Stylus touchpoint as
//! well as other touches such as those by the palm or fingers.
-(NSArray *)getTouches;



//! @function getTrackedTouches
//! @returns returns the TrackedTouches for all touchpoints currently known about, which would include
//! the StylusTouchPoint if there is one..
-(NSArray *)getTrackedTouches;



//! @function clearTouches
//! @returns nothing
//! @abstract this is an important function that allows one to clear the TrackedTouch list. This should
//! only be used in cases where dead zones are being seen such as after a page turn or something of that
//! nature. Otherwise, it should not be used as it effectively erases the knowledge of currently
//! UITouches
-(void)clearTouches;



//! @function setHandedness
//! @param handedness the hand be used to draw.
//! @returns nothing
//! @abstract This function tells the SDK which hand the user is drawing with. Typically this is
//! autodetected (to eh_Right or eh_Left), but if touch rejection code is not being used, then this is a necessary step for
//! offset correction. If it is set by the SDK user the autodetection will not override it.
-(void) setHandedness:(ehandedness)handedness;



//! @function getHandedness
//! @returns the hand which the user uses to draw with.
//! @abstract This function returns the hand that is being used to draw, this can be provided by
//! the SDK user via the setHandedness call or automatically detected. If it is set by the SDK user
//! the autodetection will not override it. If you are not using the touch rejection code, please be sure
//! to set the handedness in the SDK.
-(ehandedness)getHandedness;



//! @function setOrientation
//! @returns nothing.
//! @abstract tells the touch manager the orientation to ensure offsets work correctly
-(void) setOrientation:(UIDeviceOrientation)orientation_I __deprecated_msg("No longer needed.  Orientation is now calculated internally.");



//! @function getOrientation
//! @returns the orienation of the menu bar.
//! @abstract this function is basically the same as the [[UIDevice CurrentDevice] orientation] call
-(UIDeviceOrientation)getOrientation __deprecated_msg("No longer needed.  Orientation is now calculated internally");



//! @function registerView
//! @returns nothing
//! @abstract this function registers the view with the touch manager
-(void) registerView:(UIView*)view;



//! @function unregisterView
//! @returns nothing
//! @abstract this function unregisters the view with the touch manager
-(void) unregisterView;



//! @property timingOffset
//! @abstract This property is used to set the timing for the touch rejection if you are seeing dropped
//! stylus strokes, then one may want to adjust this. The default setting is 55,000 microseconds
//! (55 milliseconds). One may need to increase the delay to 60,000 microseconds in accordance with
//! the performance of the application.
//! PLEASE NOTE: log messages slow down your machine and change the timing, one might want to remove
//! unnecessary log messages before changing this timing.
@property (readwrite) unsigned int timingOffset;



//! @property: theStylusTouch
//! @abstract This property is used to provide easy access to the stylus' TrackedTouch Class. If the
//! pointer is null, then the stylus has not been identified yet.
@property (readonly) TrackedTouch *theStylusTouch;



//! @property touchRejectionEnabled
//! @abstract This property is used to enable or disable the touch rejection feature.
@property (readwrite) BOOL touchRejectionEnabled;
